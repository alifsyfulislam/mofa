                                    <p>"Good afternoon. At the offset, I on behalf of my government, the government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, thank the organisers of the Berlin Climate and Security Conference 2020. This is a very special year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and we cannot physically get together to meet, greet and to listen to each other in an auditorium.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>  Excellencies, we observe that the Covid-19, or Corona pandemic, was not selective of any race, colour, group, rich or poor nations. The mighty powers and sophisticated weapons of the developed countries could not help saving lives. This pandemic is an eye-opener for all of us to review and reflect that, if global warming goes up above 1.5 ºC, then it’s not only Bangladesh, Maldives or Kiribati that will suffer. Its claws may inundate the financial harbour Boston, the learning centres of Harvard or MIT, and the resorts of Florida – many cities and towns that we are so proud of may not exist at all for our future generations.

                                    </p>
